```html
<script src="lightbox.js"></script>
<script>
  new Lightbox(true);
</script>
```

You can instance the object with true/false, default value is false.

if ```new Lightbox(false)```, you will have to add mannualy the attribute ``[data-lightbox]`` for each image tag that you want be a lightbox.
